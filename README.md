# ZLOrigin Guide
### 0. Prerequisities
- .NET Framework 4.5.2 (usually preinstalled on Windows 10)
- [Visual C++ 2013](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=40784)
### 1. Register an account
Go to [ZLOEmu.net](https://zloemu.net/) and register an account that you will have to use later.

### 2. Setting up ZClient
Download the [ZClient.exe](https://zloemu.net/files/ZClient.exe) and create a folder for it, then move the executable into it. Client generates some files so it's preferred that you have a folder exclusively for it. 
Fill in your account data that you created in the first step.

Leave the app running it background. It will serve as a proxy that will let you access the modded Origin. You need it every time you want to play.

### 3. Installing ZLOrigin
Download the [ZLOrigin Installer](https://zloemu.net/files/ZLOriginSetup.zip) then unpack and install it. It may be incompatible with the normal Origin client if it's already installed - try installing ZLOrigin to a different partition than the original Origin for it to work. (not tested, it's better to just not have the Origin client installed)
After launching the ZLOrigin, you should be already logged in.

### 4. Installing games
In the ZLOrigin, proceed to the "My Games" tab:

From here you can download any game that you want (Sims 2/3/4 for example), and the ZLOrigin's installer will take care of that.

Sometimes when starting a download the installer may show an errors with unknown error codes - skip through of all them, your download should continue anyway

### 5. Launching games
After your games have been installed you can just run them from ZLOrigin. For the next launch you don't need to launch ZLOrigin anymore - you can just use the ZClient to run them.
